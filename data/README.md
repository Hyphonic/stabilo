## Additional Files

- **[video.txt](./video.txt)**: Contains unnormalized bounding boxes (BBs) in YOLO format (`x_c, y_c, w, h`) for vehicles detected in each frame, generated using the [geo-trax](https://github.com/rfonod/geo-trax) framework. Each row represents a distinct BB, with the frame number in the 0th column and the BB coordinates in columns 2â€“5. These BBs can serve as exclusion masks during stabilization and/or as tracks (BBs) to be stabilized.
- **[video_stab.mp4](./video_stab.mp4)**: Stabilized version of the original video, using the zero-th frame as the reference frame for stabilization.
- **[video_viz.mov](./video_viz.mov)**: Visualization of the stabilization process, showing frame transformations relative to the reference frame. Note that `video_viz.mp4`, the actual visualization video, has been replaced in the repository due to its large size. 
- **[video_stab.txt](./video_stab.txt)**: Identical to `video.txt`, but the BBs are replaced with the stabilized BBs.
- **[video_track.mp4](./video_track.mp4)**: Visualization of the original BB tracks and the stabilized BB tracks. The original BB tracks are shown in red, while the stabilized BB tracks are shown in green.
